## Practical Demonstration

### Demo 1: Batch Effect Correction with ComBat
```python
# Example R code for ComBat batch correction
library(sva)

# Expression data matrix (genes × samples)
expr_data <- read.table("expression_matrix.txt")

# Batch information
batch_info <- read.table("batch_info.txt")

# Batch correction
corrected_data <- ComBat(expr_data, batch=batch_info$batch)
```

### Demo 2: Multiomics PCA Integration
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load multiomics data
rna_data = pd.read_csv("rna_expression.csv")
protein_data = pd.read_csv("protein_abundance.csv")

# Standardize and concatenate
scaler = StandardScaler()
rna_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(rna_data)
protein_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(protein_data)

combined_data = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(rna_scaled), pd.DataFrame(protein_scaled)], axis=1)

# Joint PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=10)
pca_result = pca.fit_transform(combined_data)
```
